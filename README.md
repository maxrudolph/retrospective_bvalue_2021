Code and Data for "A Retrospective Analysis of b-value Changes Preceding Strong Earthquakes" by Nicolas D. DeSalvio and Maxwell L. Rudolph (In Review)

primary_code_and_data contains all of the data and code to generate the initial results of the study, including specific scripts to generate Figures 3, 4 and 5.

post_processing contains all of the intitial results and post-processing scripts which analyze the success of the parameter combinations. Specific scripts to generate Figures 2 and S1 are here.

Each file contains everything in the correct location to immediately run the code.
Within primary_code_and_data, the b_output file is populated with graphs used in the paper, while the images are redundant, the file structure they are contained in is utilized by the code.
All zip files must be unzipped.
